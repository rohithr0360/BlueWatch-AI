# BlueWatch: Towards a future where waters aren't choking on plastic

Welcome to BlueWatch, an innovative AI model developed using YOLOv8 object detection algorithm. BlueWatch aims to detect the presence of plastic in both the surface and depth of the oceans. As aquatic plastic pollution poses a significant threat to marine species and human consumption, our model steps in to address this critical issue.

## Project Overview

Aquatic plastic pollution is a major environmental concern, affecting marine life and ecosystems worldwide. BlueWatch is designed to contribute to the mitigation of this issue by providing accurate detection of plastic debris in oceanic environments.

## Features

- **YOLOv8 Object Detection:** BlueWatch employs YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, to identify plastic debris in oceanic environments.
- **React-Based Website:** Our project features a user-friendly React-based website that showcases statistics and highlights the environmental impact of our detection system.
- **Flask Integration:** BlueWatch seamlessly integrates with Flask, allowing users to test the AI model by providing sample videos. The Flask web page redirects users to our model, which accurately locates plastic debris with high precision.
- **Deployment on EC2:** The entire project is deployed using the EC2 hosting platform, ensuring accessibility and scalability.

## Workflow

1. **Explore Statistics:** Visit our React-based website to explore statistics and learn about the environmental impact of plastic pollution in oceans.
2. **Test the Model:** Utilize the Flask web page to test our AI model by providing sample videos. Experience the accuracy of BlueWatch as it locates plastic debris in real-time footage.
3. **Integration with Robotics:** Consider the significant impact of integrating BlueWatch with robotic hardware, enhancing its capabilities and effectiveness in removing plastic from oceanic environments.

## Installation
